    <body>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is William Boulton, but you can call me Bill. I’m majoring in Information Management and Technology at the iSchool and minoring in <strong>Cannabis Studies</strong>. I’m interested in working with all different types of technology that helps cannabis companies run their day-to-day operations smoothly.

    I work full time at Syracuse University and go to school part time finishing my degree. I have a beautiful wife named Sarah and we just welcomed our first baby girl, Marley Anna Boulton to the world on December 3rd, 2021. I’m an avid hiker and trying to complete the 46 high peaks in the Adirondack Mountains. I love to play golf and I’m a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan. Bills Mafia all the way. I love Syracuse football and basketball and have had season tickets to football for years. I love all sports, films, and documentaries.

    <h2> Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
    I was born with a vascular malformation on the right side of my face, tongue, inside cheek and throat. I have had multiple surgeries throughout my life and that has made me the strong person I am today. I’m very personable and can interact with anyone. Don’t be afraid to come talk to me if you have any questions about me or any other interests we may have in common!
